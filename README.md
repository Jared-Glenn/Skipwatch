### Possible Genres
- Turn-based combat
- RPG elements (gear and skills)
- Roguelite
- City Builder
- Relationship/Customer manager
- *Try "Keep Driving" game.*
- Stardew Valley type?
- Base it on Doordash:
- Get offers for rides, but the skill is in determining which fares are going to result in a worthwhile income.
- You feel genuinely needed, but just can't afford every fare. Some fares are underpaid, but might have a sob story attached.
- We could have a number of storylines that people follow or don't.

### Story
- Some dude inherits his grandfather's skipwatch or something?
- Some guy wants to find and make use of old skipwatch routes?
- Someone gets stuck in the wilderness and finds a skipwatch and uses it to get home, then uses it to make money.

### Storylines

#### Evagail and her kids trying to find her missing brother.
- A trip into the territory. Multiple rides to get far in so we meet her and her kids.
- We catch up with her later as she follows him to another place (further north,maybe?)

#### Creating a Union with other skipwatch conductors
-Choose between that and being a bootlicker or something.
- Give some options: posters, meeting others, spreading the word organically

#### Rivalry with another skipwatch conductor
- Team Rocket approach? Multiple conductors.
- Malfoy approach? Evil singular villain.
- Maverick approach? Friendly rivalry.

#### Douser and Older Siblings
- Traveling wherever there's a job to buy food.
- Young kid douser.
- Several older siblings, including a 15-17 year old.

#### Newlywed Couple
- Eloping together.
- Helping them find work and a home.
- Deciding whether or not to help family searching for them.
- Helping them find a new home when the first doesn't work out.

### Characters
- Innkeepers in towns along the routes.
- Partner who helps on the trail, like a porter or bagman.
- Station watchers.
- Recurring passengers.
- Someone with the Drift who begs for a ride back east, despite being contageous.

### Style
- Pixel art would be simple and easier than full art.
- Standard Manifest art for portraits, but simpler, pixelated graphics

## Mechanics

### Finding Passengers
- Go to the town's Skip Station and decide which passengers to help, if any.
- You can choose to go anywhere, with or without passengers, but it's expensive. ... But why?
- Some sort of resource? Maybe Dibel replacements or something?
- Keep track of schedules so passengers don't choose to take a wagon or train instead.
- That would be an enormous cast, though, right? How many towns are we thinking? 10? 20? 50?
- Make a basic map over a travelable region.
- Something big but simple like Rimworld, or a number of more detailed smaller maps.
- It would be neat if there were places in the wilds you're never told to go, but which you can find by treking into the forest on your own.

### Controlling the Skipwatch
- Minigames?
- Latching a thread (from the Southern Spike) and using it to fling yourself?
- Setting up the skip happens 15 minutes before the actual skip.
- Should be done by choosing the most efficient route, but some stations are in safer areas than others.
- Controlling the knobs seems important. Maybe it's a game of precisely controlling a crosshairs to point at a given destination and messing up sends you further off.
- What if it's a management game like Stardew Valley. Keeping the smaller subsystems going amounts to a series of "chores."

### Walking to the Station
-Actually show the distance, allowing for an accident later on that puts you WAY off course.
- Platforming?
- TTRPG movement?

### Protecting the Station
- First Person Shooter?
- Turn based combat?
- Shooting gallary?
- RTS?

### Location
- Del Vernar
- Steps - Kind of the default. Maybe a bit of Fallen Mesa or Westilver. Maybe a four corners type situation? Or you skip between several maps or something?
