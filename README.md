## Mechanics

### Finding Passengers
- Go to the town's Skip Station and decide which passengers to help, if any.
- You can choose to go anywhere, with or without passengers, but it's expensive. ... But why?
- Some sort of resource? Maybe Dibel replacements or something?
- Keep track of schedules so passengers don't choose to take a wagon or train instead.
- That would be an enormous cast, though, right? How many towns are we thinking? 10? 20? 50?
- Make a basic map over a travelable region.

### Controlling the Skipwatch
- Minigames?
- Latching a thread (from the Southern Spike) and using it to fling yourself?

### Walking to the Station
-Actually show the distance, allowing for an accident later on that puts you WAY off course.
- Platforming?
- TTRPG movement?

### Protecting the Station
- First Person Shooter?
- Turn based combat?
- Shooting gallary?
